The toe box and collar sport angular lines modeled after a Gundam suit, complemented by interchangeable, redesigned Swoosh branding. The lateral heel adds a dark pink unicorn emblem, while underfoot, a concentric rubber outsole is included for traction.","urlKey":"nike-dunk-sb-high-gundam-black-thunder-blue","resellLinks":{"stockX":"https://stockx.com/nike-dunk-sb-high-gundam-black-thunder-blue","flightClub":"https://www.flightclub.com/gundam-x-dunk-high-sb-project-unicorn-banshee-norn-dh7717-banshee","goat":"http://www.goat.com/sneakers/gundam-x-dunk-high-sb-project-unicorn-banshee-norn-dh7717-banshee"}},{"lowestResellPrice":{"stockX":450,"goat":500,"flightClub":500},"imageLinks":[],"_id":"619be9e38c6ec20ec8a53ace","shoeName":"Jordan 1 Retro High OG A Ma Maniére","brand":"Jordan","silhoutte":"Jordan 1 Retro High OG","styleID":"DO7097-100","make":"Jordan 1 Retro High OG","colorway":"Sail/Burgundy Crush","retailPrice":200,"thumbnail":"https://images.stockx.com/images/Air-Jordan-1-Retro-High-OG-A-Ma-Maniére.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&trim=color&q=90&dpr=2&updated_at=1635880040","releaseDate":"2021-12-03","description":"Following up on a spring 2021 release from the two brands, the A Ma Maniére x Air Jordan 1 High OG dropped later that same year.
